SELECT t1.Course, Count(t2.OrderID)
FROM tab AS t1
LEFT JOIN -- get all Courses for that day
 ( -- find the minimum order per customer
   SELECT CustomerID, Min(OrderID) AS OrderID
   FROM tab AS t2
   WHERE Date='17.10.2016'
   GROUP BY CustomerID
 ) AS t2
ON t1.CustomerID = t2.CustomerID 
AND t1.OrderID = t2.OrderID -- only one row per customer
WHERE Date='17.10.2016'
GROUP BY t1.Course

summarise(filter(inner_join(filter(summarise(dat1 %>% group_by(Course), n = n()), n >= 2), dat1), Date == 10172016) %>% group_by(Course), n = n())
